```

### If Issues Occur After Deployment:

```bash
# Quick rollback
git checkout dashboard-working-no-email-banner
npm run build
firebase deploy

# More thorough rollback if needed
git reset --hard d6dc11e
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

## Success Criteria Checklist

### Technical Success:

- [ ] Dashboard works exactly as before

- [ ] Fast loading times maintained
- [ ] No user confusion or support tickets

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Safety Rules:

1. **Never modify Dashboard.tsx beyond the two specified lines**
2. **Test immediately after each change**
3. **Keep backup branches at all times**
4. **Roll back immediately if any authentication errors occur**
5. **Preserve working commit d6dc11e as fallback**

### Monitoring Points:

- Console errors related to authentication
- Dashboard load time changes
- Email delivery failures
- User experience degradation
- Support ticket increases
