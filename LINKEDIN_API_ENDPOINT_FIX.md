# LinkedIn API Endpoint Fix - Latest Update

## 🔍 **Issue Identified**

The LinkedIn OAuth flow was working correctly (token exchange successful), but the Firebase Function was failing with a **403 ACCESS_DENIED** error when trying to fetch user profile data:

```
Error: Not enough permissions to access: people.GET.NO_VERSION
```

## 🛠️ **Root Cause**

The issue was with the LinkedIn API endpoints being used:

### **Before (Incorrect):**

```typescript
// Profile endpoint - WRONG
"https://api.linkedin.com/v2/people/~:(id,firstName,lastName)";

// Email endpoint - WRONG
"https://api.linkedin.com/v2/clientAwareMemberHandles?q=members&projection=(elements*(primary,type,handle~))";
```

### **After (Correct):**

```typescript
// Profile endpoint - CORRECT
"https://api.linkedin.com/v2/me";

// Email endpoint - CORRECT
"https://api.linkedin.com/v2/emailAddresses?q=members&projection=(elements*(handle~))";
```

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

1. **Updated Profile Endpoint**: Changed from deprecated `people/~` endpoint to `v2/me`
2. **Updated Email Endpoint**: Changed to the correct `emailAddresses` endpoint
3. **Improved Email Parsing**: Added logic to find primary email address
4. **Updated Interfaces**: Fixed TypeScript interfaces to match API responses

## 📊 **Deployment Status**

✅ **Firebase Function Updated**: Latest deployment includes corrected LinkedIn API endpoints
✅ **OAuth Flow**: Standard OAuth 2.0 without PKCE (working)
✅ **Token Exchange**: Successfully obtaining access tokens
✅ **API Permissions**: Now using endpoints compatible with `profile email` scopes

## 🔄 **Expected Flow Now**

1. ✅ User authorizes LinkedIn access
2. ✅ Authorization code exchanged for access token
3. ✅ Profile data fetched from `/v2/me`
4. ✅ Email data fetched from `/v2/emailAddresses`
5. ✅ Firebase user created/updated
6. ✅ Custom token generated
7. ✅ User signed into Firebase

## 🧪 **Testing**

The LinkedIn authentication at `https://app.linkedgoals.app` should now work completely without 403 errors.

**Expected Success Logs:**

```
🚀 LinkedIn OAuth Firebase Function called (v2 API) - Standard OAuth
📦 Request data: { hasCode: true, hasState: true }
✅ LinkedIn config loaded successfully
🔄 Exchanging code for access token (standard OAuth)...
✅ Token exchange successful
