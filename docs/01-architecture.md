# Architecture & System Design

This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture, data flow, and design decisions.

### High-level system architecture diagrams and explanations

_(TODO: Add high-level system architecture diagrams. This can be created using Mermaid syntax or by embedding images of diagrams from tools like Lucidchart or draw.io. Explain the major components and their interactions.)_

### Data flow diagrams showing how information moves through the system

_(TODO: Add data flow diagrams. Show how data is ingested, processed, stored, and accessed by users and other systems.)_

### Database schema with relationships and constraints

_(TODO: Add database schema. This can be an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) and a description of the tables, columns, relationships, and constraints. Mention the database technology used, e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firestore.)_

Based on `firestore.indexes.json` and `database.rules.json` it seems this project uses Firestore.

### API architecture (REST/GraphQL endpoints, authentication flows)

_(TODO: Describe the API architecture. Specify if it's REST, GraphQL, or something else. Document the main endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms like JWT, OAuth2, etc.)_

### Third-party integrations and their purposes

_(TODO: List all third-party integrations, e.g., Stripe for payments, SendGrid for emails, etc. Explain the purpose of each integration and link to their documentation.)_

### Microservices boundaries and communication patterns

_(TODO: If the system uses a microservices architecture, describe the boundaries of each microservice and how they communicate with each other, e.g., REST APIs, message queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka, gRPC.)_

### Caching strategies and layers

_(TODO: Describe the caching strategies used in the application. This could include client-side caching, CDN caching, server-side caching (e.g., Redis), and database caching. Explain what is cached, for how long, and the cache invalidation strategy.)_
