# Common Tasks & Debugging

This document provides a guide for common development tasks and debugging procedures.

### How to add new features (step-by-step)

_(TODO: Provide a step-by-step guide on how to add a new feature. This could include things like creating a new branch, adding new components/pages, writing tests, and submitting a pull request.)_

### Common debugging scenarios and solutions

_(TODO: List common debugging scenarios and their solutions. For example, "If you are getting a CORS error, check the allowed origins in the server configuration." or "If you are having authentication issues, clear your browser's local storage and cookies.")_

### Performance profiling tools and techniques

_(TODO: Describe the tools and techniques used for performance profiling. For example, using the browser's developer tools (Lighthouse, Performance tab) or server-side profiling tools.)_

### How to reproduce production issues locally

_(TODO: Provide guidance on how to reproduce production issues in the local development environment. This might involve checking out a specific version of the code, using production data dumps (anonymized), or configuring the local environment to mimic production.)_

### Useful debugging commands and tools

_(TODO: List any useful debugging commands or tools that can help with development. For example, specific `npm` scripts for debugging or browser extensions.)_
