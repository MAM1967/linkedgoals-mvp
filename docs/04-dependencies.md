# Dependencies & Package Management

This document provides information about the project's dependencies and how to manage them.

### Key dependencies and why they were chosen

_(TODO: List the key dependencies of the project, e.g., React, Express, Webpack, etc. Provide a brief explanation for why each dependency was chosen. This gives context on the technology stack.)_

### Dependencies that should NOT be updated (with reasons)

_(TODO: List any dependencies that are pinned to a specific version and should not be updated without careful consideration. Explain the reasons, such as breaking changes in newer versions or compatibility issues.)_

### Package manager commands for common tasks

_(TODO: List the common commands used for package management. For example, `npm install` to install dependencies, `npm install <package>` to add a new dependency, `npm outdated` to check for outdated dependencies, and `npm update` to update dependencies.)_

The project uses `npm` based on the presence of `package-lock.json`.

### How to handle dependency conflicts

_(TODO: Provide guidance on how to resolve dependency conflicts. This might involve using `npm`'s `--force` or `--legacy-peer-deps` flags, or manually inspecting the dependency tree to find the conflicting packages.)_
