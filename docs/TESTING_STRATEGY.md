# Testing Strategy

## 🚨 **STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE: Staging-First Testing**

### 🎯 **Core Principle**

**NEVER TEST DIRECTLY IN PRODUCTION.** All testing must be done on staging environment that replicates production.

### 📋 **Mandatory Testing Workflow**

#### 1. **Pre-Testing Setup**

- ✅ Replicate production Firestore data to staging
- ✅ Mirror production configuration and secrets
- ✅ Ensure staging environment matches production infrastructure
- ✅ Verify staging URLs and OAuth configurations work

#### 2. **Code Deployment Sequence**

```bash
# REQUIRED ORDER - NO EXCEPTIONS
1. Deploy to staging FIRST
   firebase use linkedgoals-staging
   npm run build && firebase deploy

2. Test on staging COMPLETELY
   - Manual testing of changed features
   - Automated test suite execution
   - User acceptance testing
   - Performance validation

3. Production deployment ONLY after staging passes
   firebase use linkedgoals-d7053
   npm run build && firebase deploy
```

#### 3. **Testing Requirements**

- ✅ **All user flows** must work on staging
- ✅ **Email functionality** tested with staging email addresses
- ✅ **LinkedIn OAuth** tested with staging redirect URLs
- ✅ **Database operations** verified with staging data
- ✅ **Performance** validated under staging load

#### 4. **Data Replication Protocol**

```bash
# Export production data
firebase use linkedgoals-d7053
firebase firestore:export gs://linkedgoals-d7053-backup/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Import to staging
firebase use linkedgoals-staging
firebase firestore:import gs://linkedgoals-d7053-backup/YYYY-MM-DD
```

### 🚫 **PROHIBITED PRACTICES**

- ❌ Testing email verification on production emails
- ❌ Creating test data in production Firestore
- ❌ Testing OAuth flows with production LinkedIn app
- ❌ Performance testing against production infrastructure
- ❌ Any testing that could affect production users

### ✅ **APPROVED TESTING PRACTICES**

- ✅ All testing on staging environment
- ✅ Production data replicated to staging for realistic testing
- ✅ Staging-specific test accounts and data
- ✅ Automated tests run against staging before production

## 🏗️ **Environment Configuration**

### Staging Environment Setup Required:

1. **Firebase Project**: Create `linkedgoals-staging` project
2. **OAuth Configuration**: Add staging URLs to LinkedIn app
3. **Data Replication**: Setup automated prod→staging data sync
4. **Configuration Sync**: Replicate secrets and settings

## 🎯 **Testing Priorities for MVP Launch**

### **✅ COMPLETED: Unit Testing**

- ✅ Component rendering and user interactions
- ✅ Form validation and error handling
- ✅ Mock Firebase operations
- ✅ React Router navigation
- **Status**: 22/22 tests passing

## 🔥 **CRITICAL - Must Complete Before Launch**

### **1. Integration Testing**

Test real Firebase operations and component integration:

```bash
# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

**Key Areas:**

- [ ] Goal CRUD operations with real Firebase
- [ ] User authentication flow
- [ ] Check-in creation and linking to goals
- [ ] Social sharing functionality
- [ ] Data persistence and retrieval

### **2. End-to-End (E2E) Testing**

Test complete user journeys:

**Critical User Flows:**

- [ ] New user registration → Goal creation → Daily check-in
- [ ] Existing user login → View dashboard → Update progress
- [ ] Goal completion flow
- [ ] Social sharing workflow
- [ ] LinkedIn integration

**Tools Recommended:**

- Cypress or Playwright for E2E testing
- Test against staging environment

### **3. Firebase Security Rules Testing**

Ensure data security:

```bash
# Install Firebase emulator suite
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase emulators:start
```

**Test Scenarios:**

- [ ] Users can only access their own data
- [ ] Proper authentication requirements
- [ ] Write permissions are correctly restricted
- [ ] No data leakage between users

---

## 🚨 **HIGH PRIORITY - Complete Within 1 Week**

### **4. Performance Testing**

- [ ] **Lighthouse Audits**: Target 90+ Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices
- [ ] **Core Web Vitals**: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- [ ] **Bundle Size Analysis**: Ensure app loads quickly on mobile
- [ ] **Firebase Query Optimization**: Test with realistic data volumes

### **5. Cross-Browser Testing**

Test on primary browsers:

- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile Safari (iOS)
- [ ] Mobile Chrome (Android)

### **6. Mobile Responsiveness**

- [ ] iPhone SE (small screen)
- [ ] iPhone 12/13/14 (standard)
- [ ] iPad (tablet)
- [ ] Android phones (various sizes)
- [ ] Touch interactions work properly

### **7. Accessibility Testing**

- [ ] Screen reader compatibility (VoiceOver, NVDA)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Color contrast ratios (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Focus management
- [ ] Alt text for images

---

## 📋 **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Nice to Have**

### **8. Load Testing**

- [ ] Test with 100+ concurrent users
- [ ] Firebase Firestore read/write limits
- [ ] Authentication bottlenecks

### **9. Error Handling & Recovery**

- [ ] Network failure scenarios
- [ ] Firebase downtime simulation
- [ ] Graceful degradation
- [ ] Offline functionality (if applicable)

### **10. Data Migration & Backup**

- [ ] Export user data functionality
- [ ] Database backup procedures
- [ ] Data recovery processes

---

## 🎭 **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**

### **Beta Testing Program**

- [ ] 10-20 target users
- [ ] 1-2 week testing period
- [ ] Collect feedback on:
  - User experience
  - Feature usability
  - Performance issues
  - Bug reports

### **Feedback Collection**

- [ ] In-app feedback widget
- [ ] User interviews
- [ ] Analytics setup (Google Analytics/Mixpanel)
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry)

---

## 🛠 **Testing Tools Setup**

### **E2E Testing Setup**

```bash
# Install Cypress
npm install --save-dev cypress

# Or install Playwright
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
```

### **Performance Monitoring**

```bash
# Install Lighthouse CI
npm install --save-dev @lhci/cli

# Install bundle analyzer
npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer
