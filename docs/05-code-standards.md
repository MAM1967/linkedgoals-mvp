# Code Patterns & Standards

This document describes the code patterns, standards, and conventions used throughout the codebase.

### Error handling patterns used throughout the codebase

_(TODO: Describe the error handling strategy. For example, using try-catch blocks for synchronous code, `.catch()` for promises, and global error handlers. Mention any custom error classes.)_

### Logging standards and levels

_(TODO: Explain the logging standards. What to log, when to log, and at what level (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR). Mention the logging library used, if any.)_

### State management patterns (Redux, Context, etc.)

_(TODO: Describe the state management solution used in the frontend. Explain the structure of the state, how to access and update it, and any patterns to follow.)_

### Form validation approaches

_(TODO: Explain how form validation is handled. Mention any libraries used (e.g., Formik, React Hook Form) and the patterns for displaying validation errors.)_

### Authentication/authorization implementation

_(TODO: Describe how authentication and authorization are implemented. Explain the login/logout flow, how user sessions are managed, and how access to different parts of the application is restricted based on user roles.)_

### Testing patterns and conventions

_(TODO: Describe the patterns and conventions for writing tests. For example, the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern, and conventions for naming test files and describing tests.)_
