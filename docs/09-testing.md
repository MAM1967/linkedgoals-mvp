# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the project.

### Testing philosophy and coverage expectations

_(TODO: Describe the testing philosophy for the project. For example, following the testing pyramid (unit, integration, end-to-end tests). Mention the expected code coverage targets, if any.)_

There is a `TESTING_STRATEGY.md` in the root directory that should be consulted and its content probably moved here.

### How to run different test suites

_(TODO: Provide instructions on how to run the different test suites, e.g., unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Include the commands to run each suite.)_

The project has `jest.config.cjs` for Jest (unit/integration tests) and a `cypress/` directory for E2E tests.

### Mock strategies for external services

_(TODO: Explain the strategies for mocking external services in tests. Mention any libraries used for mocking, such as `nock` or `jest.mock`.)_

### Test data management

_(TODO: Describe how test data is managed. For example, using fixtures, factories (e.g., Factory Bot), or a dedicated test database.)_

### Performance testing setup

_(TODO: Provide information on the performance testing setup. Mention the tools used (e.g., JMeter, Gatling, k6) and how to run the performance tests.)_
