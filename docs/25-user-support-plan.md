## 📊 Support Channel Strategy

### 🤖 **Primary: FREE AI-Powered Support (MVP Phase)**

**Platform**: Discord Community + OpenAI API Integration

**Why Discord for MVP**:

- ✅ **100% FREE** - No monthly costs during pre-revenue phase

- ✅ **Professional appearance** - Custom branding and channels
- ✅ **Easy migration** - Export data when moving to paid solution

**Implementation**:

```typescript
// React integration example
import { IntercomProvider, useIntercom } from "react-use-intercom";

const INTERCOM_APP_ID = "your_app_id";

function App() {
  return (
    <IntercomProvider appId={INTERCOM_APP_ID}>
      <LinkedGoalsApp />
    </IntercomProvider>
  );
}

// In components
const { boot, show, update } = useIntercom();
```

### 📧 **Secondary: AI-Enhanced Email Support**

**Platform**: Intercom Email + Gmail with GPT-4 Integration

**Email Strategy**:

- **Primary**: support@linkedgoals.app

- **Business**: contact@linkedgoals.app

**AI Email Processing Workflow**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Email] --> B[Gmail Receives]
    B --> C[GPT-4 Analysis]
    C --> D{Issue Type?}
    D -->|Simple| E[Auto-Reply with Solution]
    D -->|Complex| F[Draft Response for Human Review]
    D -->|Technical| G[Forward to Developer]
    E --> H[Track Resolution]
    F --> I[Human Approval]
    I --> J[Send Response]
```

1. **Option A: Zapier + OpenAI** (Recommended for MVP)

   - Gmail → Zapier → OpenAI API → Auto-response
   - Cost: ~$30/month
   - Setup time: 2-3 days

2. **Option B: Custom Firebase Function**

   ```typescript
   import { onRequest } from "firebase-functions/v2/https";
   import OpenAI from "openai";

   export const processSupport = onRequest(async (req, res) => {
     const emailContent = req.body.message;
     const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
       model: "gpt-4",
       messages: [
         {
           role: "system",
           content: "You are a helpful support agent for LinkedGoals...",
         },
         {
           role: "user",
           content: emailContent,
         },
       ],
     });
     // Process and respond
   });
   ```
