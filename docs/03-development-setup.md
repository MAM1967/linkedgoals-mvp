# Development Environment Setup

This guide explains how to set up the local development environment for this project.

### Required Node.js/Python/etc. versions

_(TODO: Specify the required versions of programming languages and runtimes. For example, Node.js v18.x, Python 3.9.x. It's good practice to mention how to manage versions, e.g., using `nvm` or `pyenv`.)_

### Environment variables and their purposes

_(TODO: List all the required environment variables. Explain what each variable is for and where to get the values. Refer to the `env.example` file if it exists and explain how to create a `.env` file from it.)_

The project contains an `env.example` file.

### Database setup instructions

_(TODO: Provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up the local database. For a Firestore project, this might involve setting up the Firebase Emulator Suite.)_

### Local development server configuration

_(TODO: Explain how to start the local development server. Include the command to run (e.g., `npm run dev`) and what URL the application will be accessible at (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). Mention any specific configurations for the dev server.)_

### Required IDE extensions or settings

_(TODO: List any recommended IDE extensions (e.g., for VS Code) that can help with development, such as Prettier, ESLint, or language-specific extensions. Also, mention any specific IDE settings that are beneficial.)_

### Mock data setup for development

_(TODO: Explain how to set up and use mock data for development. This could involve running a script to populate the local database with mock data or using a mocking library.)_
