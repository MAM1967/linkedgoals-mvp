# Session Context - July 18, 2025

**Date:** July 18, 2025  
**Time:** 4:27 PM EDT  
**Duration:** Extended session (4+ hours)  
**Focus:** CSS Fix + Deployment Recovery + Freemium Development

## Session Overview

Started with a simple CSS fix but encountered significant deployment issues that consumed most of the session. Successfully resolved all issues and documented proper project structure.

## Major Activities Completed

### ‚úÖ Primary Issue Resolution

1. **CSS Color Fix Completed**
   - Fixed progress percentage text color in `src/components/GoalProgressCard.css`
   - Changed from `#2d3748` (dark gray) to `#ffffff` (white)
   - Deployed to production and working correctly
   - Committed to `fix/progress-percentage-color` branch

### ‚úÖ Infrastructure Recovery

2. **Marketing Site Restored**
   - `linkedgoalsweb` project restored from GitHub repo
   - Proper marketing content now serving at `https://linkedgoals.app`
   - Accidentally deployed app code resolved

3. **Production App Reverted**
   - `linkedgoals-d7053` reverted to commit `0f20059` (pre-freemium)
   - Removed accidental freemium features from production
   - `app.linkedgoals.app` clean and stable

4. **Firebase Project Structure Documented**
   - `linkedgoalsweb` = Marketing website (https://linkedgoals.app)
   - `linkedgoals-d7053` = Production application (app.linkedgoals.app)
   - `linkedgoals-staging` = Staging environment
   - `linkedgoals-development` = Development environment
   - `crestcomnyc-6c86d` = Deprecated/unrelated

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Encountered

1. **Accidental Production Deployment**
   - Freemium features deployed to production without approval
   - Violated staging-first workflow
   - Required emergency revert and cleanup

2. **Project Confusion**
   - Mixed up marketing site with app deployment targets
   - Staging environment redirecting to production domain
   - Lost development time on infrastructure issues

## Current Technical State

### Production Environment

- **Status:** Stable and clean
- **Features:** Core app functionality + CSS color fix
- **Freemium:** Completely removed (as intended)
- **Last Deploy:** July 18, 2025 - CSS fix only

### Development State

- **Active Branch:** `feature/freemium-staging-only`
- **Freemium System:** Complete but untested
- **Components:** All freemium UI components built
- **Testing:** Unit tests passing, manual testing pending

### Freemium Implementation Status

- ‚úÖ **Core Types & Interfaces** (src/types.ts)
- ‚úÖ **Plan Logic & Utilities** (src/utils/planLimits.ts, src/utils/goalCount.ts)
- ‚úÖ **UI Components** (GoalLimitWarning, GoalLimitReached, PlanStatusBadge, UpgradePrompt)
- ‚úÖ **React Hook** (usePlanLimits.ts)
- ‚úÖ **Integration** (GoalInputPage, DashboardHeader)
- ‚úÖ **Unit Tests** (Comprehensive test coverage)
- ‚ùå **Manual Testing** (Blocked by staging redirect issues)
- ‚ùå **Production Deployment** (Waiting for testing completion)

## Sprint Progress: "Freemium & Monetization Foundation" (July 18-31, 2025)

### Completed This Session

1. ‚úÖ Infrastructure cleanup and documentation
2. ‚úÖ CSS aesthetic fix (original request)

### Ready for Next Session

1. üîÑ **Freemium Manual Testing** - Resolve staging redirect or test locally
2. üìã **Complete Freemium Tasks:**
   - 3-goal limit enforcement ‚úÖ (built, needs testing)
   - Upgrade prompts ‚úÖ (built, needs testing)
   - Plan status display ‚úÖ (built, needs testing)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never deploy to production without explicit approval**
2. **Always verify Firebase project before deployment**
3. **Follow staging ‚Üí production workflow religiously**
4. **Simple fixes can become complex if proper process not followed**

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Test freemium system manually** (resolve staging environment issues)
2. **Deploy freemium to production** (after successful staging validation)
3. **Continue sprint backlog items** (premium waitlist, payment integration planning)

## Technical Debt

- Staging environment redirect issue needs investigation
- Consider separating staging and production domains more clearly

**Session End:** July 18, 2025 - 4:27 PM EDT  
**Next Session:** Continue freemium testing and deployment
