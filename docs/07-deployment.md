# Deployment & DevOps

This document provides an overview of the deployment process and DevOps practices.

### Build process and build scripts

_(TODO: Describe the build process for the application. Explain what the build scripts do and how to run them. Refer to the `package.json` scripts.)_

### Deployment pipeline overview

_(TODO: Provide an overview of the deployment pipeline. This could be a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI. Explain the different stages of the pipeline, e.g., build, test, deploy to staging, deploy to production.)_

### Environment-specific configurations

_(TODO: Explain how environment-specific configurations are managed. This could involve using different `.env` files for each environment or using a configuration management service.)_

The project uses `apphosting.yaml` and `firebase.json` which likely contain environment configurations.

### Monitoring and logging setup

_(TODO: Describe the monitoring and logging setup for the deployed application. Mention the tools used for monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Google Cloud Monitoring) and log aggregation (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, Google Cloud Logging).)_

### Rollback procedures

_(TODO: Explain the rollback procedures in case a deployment fails or introduces a critical bug. Describe how to roll back to a previous version of the application.)_

### Performance benchmarks and expectations

_(TODO: List any performance benchmarks that have been established for the application. Mention the expected response times for key APIs and any other performance metrics that are tracked.)_
