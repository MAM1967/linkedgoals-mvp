# External Integrations

This document describes the external services that the application integrates with.

### API documentation for third-party services

_(TODO: Provide links to the API documentation for all third-party services used in the project. For example, Stripe, SendGrid, etc.)_

There are several markdown files in the root of the project related to LinkedIn Oauth. These should be reviewed and their content probably moved here.

- `FINAL_LINKEDIN_OAUTH_STATUS.md`
- `LINKEDIN_API_ENDPOINT_FIX.md`
- `LINKEDIN_OAUTH_FIX_SUMMARY.md`
- `LINKEDIN_OAUTH_SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md`
- `LINKEDIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

### Authentication tokens and key management

_(TODO: Explain how authentication tokens and API keys for third-party services are managed. Mention where they are stored (e.g., environment variables, secret manager) and who has access to them.)_

### Rate limiting considerations

_(TODO: Document any rate limiting considerations for the third-party APIs. Mention the rate limits and how the application handles them to avoid getting blocked.)_

### Webhook handling

_(TODO: Describe how webhooks from third-party services are handled. Explain the webhook endpoints, the data they receive, and the logic that is executed upon receiving a webhook.)_

### Data synchronization processes

_(TODO: Explain any data synchronization processes between the application and third-party services. Describe how often the synchronization runs and how data consistency is maintained.)_
