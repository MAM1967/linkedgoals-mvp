# Admin Dashboard Plan for MVP

This document outlines the plan for creating an admin dashboard for the LinkedGoals MVP application.

### 1. **Purpose & Goals**

The primary purpose of the admin dashboard is to provide administrators with the tools to manage users, monitor application activity, and ensure the health of the platform. The key goals are:

- To enable efficient user management.
- To provide insights into application usage and key metrics.
- To facilitate content moderation and quality control.
- To centralize administrative tasks.

### 2. **Key Features**

The admin dashboard will be rolled out in phases.

**Phase 1: Core Functionality (MVP)**

- **Secure Login:** A dedicated login portal for users with an 'admin' role.
- **Dashboard Overview:** A landing page with key metrics:
  - Total number of users.
  - Number of new users (in the last 24h, 7d, 30d).
  - Number of active users.
  - Total number of goals created.
- **User Management (Read-Only):**
  - A searchable and paginated list of all users.
  - View user details: Name, email, sign-up date, last login, number of goals.
- **Goal Management (Read-Only):**
  - A list of all goals created by users.
  - Ability to view goal details.

**Phase 2: Enhanced Management**

- **User Management (Write Operations):**
  - Ability to suspend or deactivate user accounts.
  - Ability to edit user roles (e.g., grant/revoke admin access).
- **Content Moderation:**
  - Ability to flag or delete inappropriate goals or content.

**Phase 3: Advanced Analytics & Tooling**

- **Analytics Dashboard:**
  - Visual charts and graphs for user growth and engagement over time.
  - Metrics on feature usage.
- **Application Log Viewer:**
  - A simple interface to view system and error logs from Firebase.
- **Settings Management:**
  - Ability to manage some application-level settings if applicable.

### 3. **Proposed Technology Stack**

- **Frontend:** To maintain consistency and speed up development, the dashboard will be built using the same stack as the main application (React, Vite, TypeScript). It will be a separate, route-protected area of the existing frontend application.
- **Backend:** It will use the existing Firebase backend. Firestore security rules will be crucial for access control.
- **UI Components:** A component library like Material-UI or Ant Design will be used to build the interface quickly.

### 4. **Access Control**

- Access to the admin dashboard will be restricted based on a `role` field in the user's Firestore document (e.g., `role: 'admin'`).
- Firebase Security Rules will be implemented to ensure that only authenticated admin users can access and modify the necessary data.
- The admin section of the application will be protected by a route guard on the frontend that checks for the user's admin role.
