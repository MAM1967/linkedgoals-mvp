# LinkedGoals MVP Testing Strategy

## 🎯 **Testing Priorities for MVP Launch**

### **✅ COMPLETED: Unit Testing**

- ✅ Component rendering and user interactions
- ✅ Form validation and error handling
- ✅ Mock Firebase operations
- ✅ React Router navigation
- **Status**: 22/22 tests passing

---

## 🔥 **CRITICAL - Must Complete Before Launch**

### **1. Integration Testing**

Test real Firebase operations and component integration:

```bash
# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

**Key Areas:**

- [ ] Goal CRUD operations with real Firebase
- [ ] User authentication flow
- [ ] Check-in creation and linking to goals
- [ ] Social sharing functionality
- [ ] Data persistence and retrieval

### **2. End-to-End (E2E) Testing**

Test complete user journeys:

**Critical User Flows:**

- [ ] New user registration → Goal creation → Daily check-in
- [ ] Existing user login → View dashboard → Update progress
- [ ] Goal completion flow
- [ ] Social sharing workflow
- [ ] LinkedIn integration

**Tools Recommended:**

- Cypress or Playwright for E2E testing
- Test against staging environment

### **3. Firebase Security Rules Testing**

Ensure data security:

```bash
# Install Firebase emulator suite
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase emulators:start
```

**Test Scenarios:**

- [ ] Users can only access their own data
- [ ] Proper authentication requirements
- [ ] Write permissions are correctly restricted
- [ ] No data leakage between users

---

## 🚨 **HIGH PRIORITY - Complete Within 1 Week**

### **4. Performance Testing**

- [ ] **Lighthouse Audits**: Target 90+ Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices
- [ ] **Core Web Vitals**: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- [ ] **Bundle Size Analysis**: Ensure app loads quickly on mobile
- [ ] **Firebase Query Optimization**: Test with realistic data volumes

### **5. Cross-Browser Testing**

Test on primary browsers:

- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile Safari (iOS)
- [ ] Mobile Chrome (Android)

### **6. Mobile Responsiveness**

- [ ] iPhone SE (small screen)
- [ ] iPhone 12/13/14 (standard)
- [ ] iPad (tablet)
- [ ] Android phones (various sizes)
- [ ] Touch interactions work properly

### **7. Accessibility Testing**

- [ ] Screen reader compatibility (VoiceOver, NVDA)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Color contrast ratios (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Focus management
- [ ] Alt text for images

---

## 📋 **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Nice to Have**

### **8. Load Testing**

- [ ] Test with 100+ concurrent users
- [ ] Firebase Firestore read/write limits
- [ ] Authentication bottlenecks

### **9. Error Handling & Recovery**

- [ ] Network failure scenarios
- [ ] Firebase downtime simulation
- [ ] Graceful degradation
- [ ] Offline functionality (if applicable)

### **10. Data Migration & Backup**

- [ ] Export user data functionality
- [ ] Database backup procedures
- [ ] Data recovery processes

---

## 🎭 **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**

### **Beta Testing Program**

- [ ] 10-20 target users
- [ ] 1-2 week testing period
- [ ] Collect feedback on:
  - User experience
  - Feature usability
  - Performance issues
  - Bug reports

### **Feedback Collection**

- [ ] In-app feedback widget
- [ ] User interviews
- [ ] Analytics setup (Google Analytics/Mixpanel)
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry)

---

## 🛠 **Testing Tools Setup**

### **E2E Testing Setup**

```bash
# Install Cypress
npm install --save-dev cypress

# Or install Playwright
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
```

### **Performance Monitoring**

```bash
# Install Lighthouse CI
npm install --save-dev @lhci/cli

# Install bundle analyzer
npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer
```

### **Error Tracking**

```bash
# Install Sentry
npm install @sentry/react
```

---

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

### **Performance Targets**

- ✅ Page load time < 3 seconds
- ✅ Time to interactive < 4 seconds
- ✅ 95%+ uptime
- ✅ Zero critical bugs in production

### **User Experience Targets**

- ✅ 90%+ task completion rate
- ✅ < 5% bounce rate on key pages
